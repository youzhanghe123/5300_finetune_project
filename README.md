We have already implemented fine tune for text classification (based on Distilbert on IMDB dataset) with supervised full finetune (sft), IA3, Lora and Adalora.

We have also already implemented fine tune for text generation (based on small-T5 on billsum dataset) with supervised full finetune (sft), IA3, Lora and Adalora.

You can find the data preprocessing, finetuning and evaluation process in each ipyb file named after model_finetuine.ipynb.
